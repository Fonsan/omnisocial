# OmniSocial

A Rails engine for Twitter and Facebook logins using [OmniAuth](http://github.com/intridea/omniauth)

## Installation

OmniSocial requires Rails 3.

To use OmniSocial in a Rails application, simply require it in the Gemfile:

    gem 'omnisocial'

Then install it by running `bundle`.

Once this is done, run `rails g omnisocial` to copy an initializer, database migration and some CSS and image assets into your base application directory.

Then edit `config/initializers/omnisocial.rb` and include your application's Twitter and Facebook OAuth configuration.

Then run `rake db:migrate` to create the user and login_account tables.

Finally, test that the logins work by accessing `/login` inside your application.
