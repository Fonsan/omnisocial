# TODO

* Change the colours of the big login buttons (make them blue-ish)
* Make the CSS less heirarchy specific (so the buttons can work outside the #oauth div)
* Publish to rubygems.org

* Do I need a Gemfile in this project?
* Add a USAGE file to the generator
* Perhaps add a generator option to skip the migration (or split the generator into tasks for initializer, migration and file copies)
* Use i18n for the flash messages so they can be overridden in the app
